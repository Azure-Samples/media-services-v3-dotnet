When a user requests Widevine-protected content, the player application requests a license from the Media Services license service. If the player application is authorized, the Media Services license service issues a license to the player. A Widevine license contains the decryption key that can be used by the client player to decrypt and stream the content.|
| [ContentProtection/OfflineFairPlay](/ContentProtection/OfflineFairPlay)|This sample demonstrates how to dynamically encrypt your content with Apple FairPlay DRM and play the content without requesting each time a new license from license service. It shows how to create a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset and an HTTP URL input, submit a job, create a ContentKeyPolicy with open restriction and FairPlay persistent configuration, associate the ContentKeyPolicy with a StreamingLocator and print a url for playback.|When a user plays the first time the FairPlay-protected content, the player application requests a license from the Media Services license service. The Media Services license service issues a license to the player and the license is persisted. Because the license is persisted, subsequent playback won't send a request to Media Services license service again.
| [ContentProtection/OfflinePlayReadyAndWidevine](/ContentProtection/OfflinePlayReadyAndWidevine)|This sample demonstrates how to dynamically encrypt your content with PlayReady and Widevine DRM and play the content without requesting each time a new license from license service. It shows how to create a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset and an HTTP URL input, submit a job, create a ContentKeyPolicy with a token restriction and PlayReady/Widevine persistent configuration, associate the ContentKeyPolicy with a StreamingLocator, get a token and print a url for playback. When a user plays the first time the DRM-protected content, the player application requests a license from the Media Services license service. If the player application is authorized, the Media Services license service issues a license to the player and the license is persisted. Because the license is persisted, subsequent playback won't send a request to Media Services license service again.|
