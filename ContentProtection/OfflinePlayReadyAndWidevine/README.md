# Offline playback with PlayReady and Widevine DRM

This sample demonstrates how to dynamically encrypt your content with PlayReady and Widevine DRM and play the content without requesting a license from license service. It shows how to perform the following tasks:

1. Creates a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset
1. Submits a job
1. Creates a ContentKeyPolicy with a token restriction and PlayReady/Widevine persistent configuration
1. Associates the ContentKeyPolicy with a StreamingLocator
1. Prints a url for playback which includes a token

When a user requests PlayReady or Widevine protected content for the first time, the player application requests a license from the Media Services license service. If the player application is authorized, the Media Services license service issues a license to the player and the license is persisted. Because the license is persisted, subsequent playback won't send a request to Media Services license service again.

> [!TIP]
> The `Program.cs` file (in the `BasicWidevine` folder) has extensive comments.
