# Dynamically encrypt your content with AES-128

This sample demonstrates how to dynamically encrypt your content with AES-128. It shows how to perform the following tasks:

1. Creates a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset
1. Submits a job
1. Creates a ContentKeyPolicy using a secret key
1. Associates the ContentKeyPolicy with StreamingLocator
1. Gets a token and print a url for playback

When a stream is requested by a player, Media Services uses the specified key to dynamically encrypt your content with AES-128 and Azure Media Player uses the token to decrypt.

> [!TIP]
> The `Program.cs` file (in the `BasicAESClearKey` folder) has extensive comments.
