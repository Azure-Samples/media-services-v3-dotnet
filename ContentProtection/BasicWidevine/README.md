# Dynamically encrypt your content with Widevine DRM

This sample demonstrates how to dynamically encrypt your content with Widevine DRM. It shows how to perform the following tasks:

1. Creates a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset
1. Submits a job
1. Creates a ContentKeyPolicy with Widevine configuration using a secret key
1. Associates the ContentKeyPolicy with StreamingLocator
1. Gets a token and print a url for playback

When a user requests Widevine-protected content, the player application requests a license from the Media Services license service. If the player application is authorized, the Media Services license service issues a license to the player. A Widevine license contains the decryption key that can be used by the client player to decrypt and stream the content.

> [!TIP]
> The `Program.cs` file (in the `BasicWidevine` folder) has extensive comments.
